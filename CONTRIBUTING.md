# Contributing to Quantum Horizon Theory (QHT)

Quantum Horizon Theory proposes that reality is bounded by a computational edge â€” a horizon beyond which simulation probability collapses and data cannot be meaningfully rendered.

We welcome scientific, mathematical, philosophical, and signal-analysis contributions that expand this model or offer counter-hypotheses.
