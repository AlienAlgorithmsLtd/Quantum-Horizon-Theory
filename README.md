The Quantum Horizon Theory is a speculative framework that reinterprets the 1977 WOW! signal not as a deliberate communication or natural cosmic event, but as the byproduct of a catastrophic failure occurring at or near a fundamental boundary in reality — a point referred to here as the Quantum Horizon.

This horizon is proposed as a theoretical threshold, distinct from physical space, where certain processes — technological, energetic, or possibly even dimensional — can no longer maintain coherence or structural stability. It may act as a filter that is not biological or sociological in nature (as suggested by the traditional Great Filter hypothesis), but physical: an energetic limit that advanced civilizations or systems eventually attempt to cross, often fatally.

The WOW! signal’s structured rise, narrow peak, and smooth decay are consistent with a system under pressure — a process that built up energy, reached a tipping point, and then failed gracefully rather than explosively. If traced, the signal may point to a location or condition near this horizon, where signals or systems become unstable. The Quantum Horizon could therefore represent a barrier to progress — not because intelligence cannot rise, but because energy systems, containment fields, or spacetime manipulations cannot survive past this invisible boundary.

In this context, the WOW! signal may have been the result of a failed transmission, jump, or experiment that touched this horizon and collapsed. It may not have been intended for us. It may have been the last echo of something else failing to move forward — and a clue that many civilizations, regardless of their technological capabilities, eventually meet the same end.
