The Quantum Horizon Theory proposes that the WOW! signal may have originated at or near a fundamental boundary — not of space, but of stability. If the Great Filter represents the stage most civilizations never pass, the Quantum Horizon is the moment they try — and fail. It marks the energetic or dimensional threshold beyond which technology, transmission, or consciousness cannot persist. The WOW! signal may be the first trace of something reaching that edge... and collapsing.
